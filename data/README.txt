This directory stores the persistent data files for the Bank System.
Files are created automatically at runtime.

Expected files:
- clients.txt          (client records)
- employees.txt        (employee records)
- admins.txt           (admin records)
- last_client_id.txt   (auto-increment tracker)
- last_employee_id.txt (auto-increment tracker)
- last_admin_id.txt    (auto-increment tracker)

DO NOT edit these files manually while the application is running.
